# HousePricePrediction
House price prediction using machine learning
# Overview:
The objective of this project is to predict the house prices by training the model with datasets containing relevant features.

# Implementation:

# Dataset- 
Dataset for House price prediction is collected from Kaggle and it contains 21613 rows , 21 columns.

# Exploratory Data Analysis-
The properties of the data, such as schema and statistical properties.
The quality of the data, like missing values and inconsistent data types.
The predictive power of the data, such as correlation of features against target.
All these steps were analysed before building the model for predicting the values.
This process lays the groundwork for the subsequent feature selection and engineering steps, and it has provided a solid foundation for building the ML models. 

# Building ML model-
Splitting the dataset into training and test sets.
Random Forest Regressor-
The model was trained with the dataset and got around  90% accuracy.
Gradient Boosting Regressor-
The model was trained with the dataset and got around  92% accuracy.
Linear Regression-
The model was trained with the dataset and got around  69% accuracy.
XGBRegressor-
The model was trained with the dataset and got around  91% accuracy.

# Result-
We infer that Gradient Boosting Regressor gives more accuracy compared to other models.
