# Overview:
The objective of this project is to predict the house prices by training the model with datasets containing relevant features.

# Implementation:

# Dataset- 
Dataset for House price prediction is collected from Kaggle and it contains 21613 rows , 21 columns.

# Exploratory Data Analysis-
The properties of the data, such as schema and statistical properties.<br>
The quality of the data, like missing values and inconsistent data types.<br>
The predictive power of the data, such as correlation of features against target.<br>
All these steps were analysed before building the model for predicting the values.<br>
This process lays the groundwork for the subsequent feature selection and engineering steps, and it has provided a solid foundation for building the ML models. 

# Building ML model-
Splitting the dataset into training and test sets.<br>
Random Forest Regressor-
The model was trained with the dataset and got around  90% accuracy.<br>
Gradient Boosting Regressor-
The model was trained with the dataset and got around  92% accuracy.<br>
Linear Regression-
The model was trained with the dataset and got around  69% accuracy.<br>
XGBRegressor-
The model was trained with the dataset and got around  91% accuracy.<br>

# Result-
We infer that Gradient Boosting Regressor gives more accuracy compared to other models.
